# autoscript
Automation and scripting workshop in Python.

## Introduction
This workshop is designed to introduce you to the world of automation and scripting using Python. 
We will cover the basics of Python programming needed to understand the scripts and then move on to
modifying and creating scripts to automate tasks.


## Prerequisites
- Python 3 (ideally 3.11)
- A code editor (e.g. Visual Studio Code, PyCharm)
- Internet connection


## Schedule
The workshop is prepared to last 2 hours and is divided into 2 parts. The schedule is as follows:
1. Introduction
2. Part 1: 
   1. Explore the `sort.py` file and run it by yourself (using `script.py`)
   2. Explanation of the code 
   3. Modify the scripts to fit your needs 
3. Part 2: 
   1. Explore the `gui.py` file and run it by yourself (using `script.py`)
   2. Explanation of the code 
   3. Modify the scripts to fit your needs
5. Wrap up


### Part 1 - Sort
This is the basis of this workshop: a script to organize pictures in your computer based
on their filenames. You can find the code in the `sort.py` file.


### Part 2 - GUI
After being comfortable with the previous script this part will take you a bit further. We will use
the `tkinter` module to build a GUI for the script. This will allow you to select the folder where the
pictures are and then sort them. You can find the code in the `gui.py` file.
