# autoscript
Automation and scripting workshop in Python.

## Introduction
This workshop is designed to introduce you to the world of automation and scripting using Python. 
We will cover the basics of Python programming needed to understand the scripts and then move on to
modifying and creating scripts to automate tasks.


## Prerequisites
- Python 3 (ideally 3.11)
- A code editor (e.g. Visual Studio Code, PyCharm)
- Internet connection


## Schedule
The workshop is prepared to last 2 hours. The schedule is as follows:
1. Introduction to the concepts of automation and scripting
2. Explore this repo and run the scripts by yourself
3. Explanation of the existing scripts
4. Modify the scripts to fit your needs
5. Wrap up


## Resources
The workshop is designed to accommodate several Python levels. If you are new to Python, 
you can follow our `part1` which is the basis of the workshop. More advanced users can 
start with `part1` and then follow `part2` and/or `part3`.


### Part 1 - Sort
This is the basis of this workshop: a script to organize pictures in your computer based
on their filenames. You can find the script in the `sort.py` file.


### Part 2 - GUI
After being comfortable with the previous script this part will take you a bit further. We will use
the `tkinter` module to build a GUI for the script. This will allow you to select the folder where the
pictures are and then organize them based on some criteria. You can find the script in the `gui.py` file.


### Part 3 - Metadata
Here you will need to use more advanced Python concepts like using a virtualenv and installing
Python modules to fulfil the needs of the script. 

In this part you will organize pictures in your computer based on the metadata that they contain.
We have limited the pictures to `.png` files to make it easier to understand the script. You can
use the Pillow library to read the metadata of the pictures and then organize them in folders.
You can find the script in the `part3` folder.
